# ðŸ”— Full-Stack Data Projects

This repository showcases integrated data projects that combine the power of **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**. Each project walks through the full analytics workflow â€” from raw data to insight â€” highlighting skills in:

- Data extraction and cleaning with SQL
- Data analysis and transformation in Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Interactive storytelling and visualization in Tableau

This is where data meets narrative â€” a fusion of technical depth and business insight.
